# My-React
This code is mainly copied from react official website with some refactor.
The React provides a simple tic tac toe and we release the code in release one.
We did the refactor and provided a gobang game by extending the existing components.

# Basic Operations
- npm (run) start: open the app locally under eslint
- npm (run) test: run test on src and see the test coverage
- npm run stylefmt: do the style fmt
- npm run stylelint: do the style lint
